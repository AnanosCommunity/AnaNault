Nault is a community driven fork of the popular Nano wallet [NanoVault](https://github.com/cronoh/nanovault) ðŸ’™

It's a fully client-side signing wallet for sending and receiving [Nano](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/) either directly in your browser at [nault.cc](https://nault.cc) or with the [desktop app](https://github.com/Nault/Nault/releases/latest).

Seamless integration with any Nano compatible RPC backend/websocket and the aim to be more frequently maintained are some of the main features. Those together will greatly increase the stability, performance and uptime.

## How To Use
Nault comes in different flavors to suit your need.
#### Desktop App
Available for Windows/Mac/Linux - just head over to the [latest release](https://github.com/Nault/Nault/releases/latest) and download the version for your OS. Arch Linux users may [install it from the (unofficial) AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nault-bin/).

If you want to verify the binary checksum there are plenty of apps to do this. One way is using a powershell or bash terminal:

* **Powershell:** `Get-FileHash -Path '.\Nault-Setup-x.x.x-Windows.exe' -Algorithm SHA256`
* **Bash:** `openssl sha256 Nault-x.x.x-Linux.AppImage`

Then compare the output hash with the one listed in the corresponding checksums file that you download.

#### Web App
You can also use Nault from any device on the web at [nault.cc](https://nault.cc).

Both the desktop (recommended) and web version supports the Ledger Nano hardware wallet. For help using it, please refer to [this guide](https://docs.nault.cc/2020/08/04/ledger-guide.html).

The web version can additionally be pulled from the [dockerhub repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/nault/nault) using: docker pull nault/nault:latest

A full security guide and other useful articles can be found in the [Nault Docs](https://docs.nault.cc).

#### Mobile App
There is no native mobile app but the web wallet contains a Progressive Web App (PWA). That allows you to run it in offline mode for remote-signing.

If you visit [nault.cc](https://nault.cc) in your phone you will be given the option to install it.

* Android: Click on "Install Nault for Android" in the menu
* iOS (Safari only): 1 - Tap the share button. 2 - Select "+ Add to home screen". 3 - Open Nault from the home screen
