# Nault

Nault is a community driven fork of the popular Nano wallet [NanoVault](https://github.com/cronoh/nanovault) ðŸ’™

It's a fully client-side signing wallet for sending and receiving [Nano](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/) in your browser either from publicly hosted [nault.cc](https://nault.cc) or by [cloning the site](https://github.com/BitDesert/Nault/tree/gh-pages) and run it locally for example in [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en).

The main difference compared to the original NanoVault is the "server-less" hosting via [vercel](https://nault.vercel.app), seamless integration with any Nano compatible RPC backend/websocket and the aim to be more frequently maintained. Those features together will greatly increase the stability, performance and uptime.
