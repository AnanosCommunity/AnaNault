Nault is a community driven fork of the popular Nano wallet [NanoVault](https://github.com/cronoh/nanovault) ðŸ’™

It's a fully client-side signing wallet for sending and receiving [Nano](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/) either directly in your browser at [nault.cc](https://nault.cc) or with the [desktop app](https://github.com/Nault/Nault/releases/latest).

Seamless integration with any Nano compatible RPC backend/websocket and the aim to be more frequently maintained are some of the main features. Those together will greatly increase the stability, performance and uptime.
