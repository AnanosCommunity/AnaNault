# Nault

Nault is a community driven fork of the popular Nano wallet [NanoVault](https://github.com/cronoh/nanovault) ðŸ’™

It's a fully client-side signing wallet for sending and receiving [Nano](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/) either directly in your browser at [nault.cc](https://nault.cc) or with the [desktop app](https://github.com/BitDesert/Nault/releases/latest).

The main difference compared to the original NanoVault is the "server-less" hosting via [vercel](https://nault.vercel.app), seamless integration with any Nano compatible RPC backend/websocket and the aim to be more frequently maintained. Those features together will greatly increase the stability, performance and uptime.

```

## Desktop Builds

*All desktop builds require that you have built a desktop version of the wallet before running!*

Run the desktop wallet in dev mode:
```bash
npm run desktop:dev
```

If electron is not installed globally, you may have run this:
```bash
